  <p class="night">Nighttime woes...</p>

  <p class="boxy"> What has happened during that night was truly something and more crazier than my other nights. As it was a very stormy day, actually the whole entire week was very stormy, as the rain wouldn't let up at all. But lucky I enjoy the rain.
    As it's the best thing ever.. But these nights, it sometimes gotten more worse, which worried me a bit...
  </p>

  <p class="takis"> But enough about the rain. It's time to talk about what happened during that night or rather almost morning, as my mother have experiened a lot of weird stuff over the nights.
    From hearing footsteps to even seeing somethings that aren't even there..

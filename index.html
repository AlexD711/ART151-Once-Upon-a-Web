  <p class="boxy"> So many things happen at night.... I can't really recall most nights though but unless it's one  What has happened during that night was truly something and more crazier than my other nights. As it was a very stormy day, actually the whole entire week was very stormy, as the rain wouldn't let up at all. But lucky I enjoy the rain.
    As it's the best thing ever.. But these nights, it sometimes gotten more worse, which worried me a bit...
  </p>

  <p class="takis"> But enough about the rain. It's time to talk about what happened during that night or rather almost morning, as my mother have experiened a lot of weird stuff over the nights.
    From hearing footsteps to even seeing somethings that aren't even there.. Could say that ghost activity happen in the house. Which I will be frank, it does happen and it's quite spooky but not as intense to how some videos point out these ghost activities. It's mainly just footsteps, but I can't hear it haha but my mother can. As she's the only one who's apparently able to hear them fully...

  <button class= "forest"> Why don't you check what's inside? </button>

  <p class= "encounter"> <b> The morning encounter.. </b> </p>
  
  <p class="story"> My mother told me something has happened during the time my dad left for work in the morning. Something that I did not expect to happen at all but it was an intriguing case... As she felt a pressence near the door, one that could be very bone-chilling, considered that my mother was still in the bed... But she thought it was me, as she called my name out. But there was no answer at all.  
  </p>

  <p class="rising"> Then what she saw... Was something that she thought was unhuman, she thought she saw a head trying to peak through the door, but she kicked the door down in order to make sure the door was closed against this thing. Not to mention, she heard a loud thud the moment she did that. So there was definetly something there in front of my parent's door but what it could've been? </p>

  <p class="creature"> It makes me wonder if there really was a creature in our house? One that just phase in and out of existence. Also a shame that my mother couldn't get a good look at it, despite her telling me that she thought was the head peeking through before she managed to stop it. But that doesn't hurt for me to think of some appearances that the thing could've had. I imagined it that it had a white figure, something that been popping up into my head whenever it came to creatures like that. 
    Ones that would stare at you during night and wouldn't harm you. Just... Stare... Which is freaky and could also imagine that it may have human looking eyes. Very creepy to think about it. 
  </p>
  
  <button class="spooky"> Something like this? </button>

   <p class= "horror"> <b> My thoughts on the horror </b> </p>

  <p class= "talk"> Now my true thoughts on this: It was very creepy hearing about it but it makes me wonder something... Something that I know I used to do a lot back around 2nd grade and that was sleep walking. I had it very bad due to a lot of stuff going on with me. 
  And I was thinking maybe.... Maybe this whole thing could've been me? Because I did feel some pain in my head but... my door was closed the moment I waked up and not to mention I was more close towards my wall than anything. Which I asked my mother if she heard anything else. 
  Almost brings for what my final answer was close and she stated that she heard my door close after the whole ordeal. Head pain, door closing, heading to my parents room? Sounds like my sleep walking case. But... It usually just repeats what I do in terms of action. I can't really recall standing near my parents room when I stayed for the night.
  Not to mention even trying to open my parent's room... So this mysterious is still... Well not solved...</p>
  
  <p class="climax"> Could sleep walking be such a bad thing? Who knows really but what did my mother encounter was truly a mystery. Which I wonder was it me or was it actually an entity that my mother has found in our home.
